Better Bookshelves
==================
##### This is a mod that modifies Minecraft's Chiseled Bookshelves to be more useful.

## <span style="color:red">ALPHA</span>
This mod is currently in alpha. This means that it is not yet complete, and may have bugs. If you find any bugs, please report them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Benjamin-Norton/BetterBookshelves/issues)

### Features
* Dedicated Book Slots: Instead of each book being added sequentially, the books are added to / removed from the slot the player clicks on.
* Enchanting Table Integration: The enchanting table will now treat Chiseled Bookshelves that contain 3 or more books as valid bookshelves for the purpose of enchanting. (The bookshelves must be facing the enchanting table)
* Book Labels: Hovering over a book in the Chiseled Bookshelf will display the book's title and relevant NBT data (WIP)
* More to come! (Depending on what Mojang decides to implement themselves... like working with hoppers)
